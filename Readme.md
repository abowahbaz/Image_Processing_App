# 🖼️ Noise Reduction & JPEG Compression

This project is a simple implementation of noise reduction and JPEG compression using Python. The project is divided into two parts, the first part is noise reduction and the second part is JPEG compression.

## ✨ Features

- Noise Reduction Using Median Filter
- Noise Reduction Using Average Filter
- JPEG Compression

## 📦 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Python 3.6** or higher installed on your machine.
- **PyQt** as the GUI library.
- **Pillow** for image processing.
- **SciPy** for image processing and mathematical operations.

## 🛠️ Installation

1. First,clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abowahbaz/Image_Processing_App.git
```

2. Install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Usage

1. Run the application using the following command:

```bash
python home.py
```

Or just double click `Run Project.bat` file and it will do all the previous steps for you 😉.

---

1. Choose the desired operation from the home menu.
   ![Home](./ReadMe%20Images/home.png)

2. JPEG Compression:

   - Choose the image you want to compress.
   - Click the compress button.

   ![JPEG Choose](./ReadMe%20Images/jpeg_choose.png)

   - The compressed image will be saved in the `Compressed` folder.

   ![JPEG Comparison](./ReadMe%20Images/jpeg_compare.png)

   - the old image and the compressed image will be displayed in the GUI window,as well as the compression ratio, with sizes comparison.

3. Noise Reduction:

   - Choose the image you want to reduce noise from.
   - Choose the filter type (Median or Average).
   - Choose the filter size.
   - Choose the edge handling method.
   - Click the filter button.

   ![Noise Choose](./ReadMe%20Images/noise_choose.png)

   - The filtered image will be saved in the `Filtered` folder.

   ![Noise Comparison](./ReadMe%20Images/noise_compare.png)

   - the old image and the filtered image will be displayed in the GUI window.
